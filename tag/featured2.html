  <div itemprop="articleBody" class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>I am impressed by the amazing progress Android&#8217;s UI has made since its
inception. With each iteration, likewise in software as in hardware, its
usability and aesthetics have steadily improved to the point where I can now
confidently buy one for my mom to replace the iPhone I recommended to her only
last year.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the other hand, one particular "feature" I intensely dislike is the
screen-off animation that emulates the brief white flash you see when an old CRT
TV monitor is powering off. Introduced in Gingerbread (2.3), it seems not to
bother most people as much as it bothers me, and even seems to be quite popular
(e.g., <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1890526">this thread</a>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I was glad to learn though that a number of people find it as annoying as I do,
for example in
<a href="http://forum.cyanogenmod.org/topic/64185-any-way-to-disable-the-screen-off-animation-in-101/">this thread</a>
and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=6519">this bug</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As a CyanogenMod fan, I was quite happy with the straightforward checkbox in the
Settings app in CyanogenMod 9 that toggled whether to play this animation. In
CM10, this option was removed, but there was an easy hack involving changing
window animation scale in the developer settings, as explained in the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=6519">second link above</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So when I updated to CM10.1 M1, I was very unpleasantly surprised to find that
this hack does not work any more either. I tried to immediately downgrade to
CM10, but then discovered that doing so requires a full data wipe (of
course&#8230;). A quick search pulled up
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1989397">this thread</a> which
proposes a simple prop edit, but the following posts in the thread suggest mixed
results.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, stuck with CM10.1, and really disgusted at this turn of events, I finally
decided to put on my hax0r gloves and get this annoying "feature" out of my face
once and for all.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Poking Around</strong></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I went to <a href="http://androidxref.com/">androidxref.com</a> and started searching
the Android source code for "screen off animation". (OK, I actually started out
with <em>grep</em>, but it didn&#8217;t take me long to realize
<a href="http://androidxref.com/">androidxref.com</a> was about sixty million times
faster - it&#8217;s really pretty cool.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I quickly found why changing the window animation scale in <strong>Jelly Bean 4.1 (and
CM10)</strong> disables the screen-off animation. The two snippets of of code
implementing this behavior are at
<a href="http://androidxref.com/4.0.4/xref/frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/PowerManagerService.java#470">line 470</a> and
<a href="http://androidxref.com/4.0.4/xref/frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/PowerManagerService.java#2228">line 2228</a>
of <code>PowerManagerService.java</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In <strong>Jelly Bean 4.2 (and CM10.1)</strong>, however, these parts of the code have been
completely refactored. The snippet of code that launches the screen-off
animation is now found at
<a href="http://androidxref.com/4.2_r1/xref/frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/power/DisplayPowerController.java#704">line 704</a>
of <code>DisplayPowerController.java</code>. Note that this new <code>DisplayPowerController</code>
class has been factored out of the old <code>PowerManagerService</code> class, and both
have moved into a separate <code>power</code> sub-directory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>The Hacking</strong></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Disclaimer: I am <strong>NOT</strong> responsible for anything that happens to your phone or
you or your house or your relationship with your wife if you follow the
instructions down here. If you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing and are scared of
bricking your phone, just give up and go watch Superbowl. Please.</em></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What did <em>not</em> change, I found, is that this code gets packaged into
<code>/system/framework/services.jar</code> on the Android system. So, let&#8217;s take a look at
this file as found in the CM10.1 image on my phone:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Copy services.jar from phone to current directory.</span>
adb pull /system/framework/services.jar
<span class="c"># Disassemble.</span>
apktool d services.jar
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>(<code><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/">apktool</a></code> is a tool that
extracts and disassembles Android APK/JAR files, and is available for Linux,
Windows and OS X.) This produces a directory, <code>services.jar.out</code>, which contains
the disassembled code of <code>services.jar</code> we just pulled from a connected phone. I
dived into the <code>DisplayPowerController</code> code and edited the <em>else</em> clause at
<a href="http://androidxref.com/4.2_r1/xref/frameworks/base/services/java/com/android/server/power/DisplayPowerController.java#704">line 704</a>
to essentially just say <code>setScreenOn(false);</code> directly instead of running
the animation first. If you look at the dissassembled code, you&#8217;d realize Dalvik
bytecode is really quite readable and easy to hack, especially since the line
number hints allow you to directly map a line in the Java source code to the
corresponding Dalvik instructions. I just had the Java source file on
<a href="http://androidxref.com">androidxref.com</a> open in a browser tab for reference
and killed instructions line by line. You can
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?5e8s5kzblav4a5g">download my patch here</a> and apply
it like this:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre>patch -d services.jar.out -Np1 &lt; path/to/disable_screen_off_animation.patch
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>(For CM10.1 nightlies (after the MR1.1 merge) and CM10.1 M2, use
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?drw5t67v24tb4x9">this patch</a> instead.
The same piece of code was shuffled around to
<a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_frameworks_base/blob/f6f6b1d37c1d5a8ba687e4d09761eb762f7269af/services/java/com/android/server/power/DisplayPowerController.java#L777">line 777</a>. For CM10.1 M3, use
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?3xghfg9yfqyj9o7">this patch</a> instead.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now re-assemble the code and push it back on to the device:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Re-assemble modified sources as services-mod.jar.</span>
apktool b services.jar.out services-mod.jar
<span class="c"># Copy services-mod.jar to /sdcard/ on phone.</span>
adb push services-mod.jar /sdcard/
<span class="c"># Remount /system partition as read-write in order to modify it.</span>
adb shell su -c <span class="s1">&#39;mount -o rw,remount /system&#39;</span>
<span class="c"># Overwrite original services.jar on phone with services-mod.jar as root.</span>
adb shell su -c <span class="s1">&#39;cp /sdcard/services-mod.jar /system/framework/services.jar&#39;</span>
<span class="c"># Reboot phone for this to take effect.</span>
adb reboot
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the phone reboots, it will say Android is upgrading and will rebuild Dalvik
cache for each application, so it might take a while. But hey, it&#8217;s worth it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Parting Words</strong></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The final product, if you just want to replace the <code>services.jar</code> on your phone, is here:</p></div>

First things first&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this is not about how to apply a rooting method, e.g., a
one-click-root, to an Android device. Rather, it is about how one could go about
<em>developing</em> a rooting method for a device that no one has rooted before, and is
told through my experiences with rooting a particular device&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the Barnes &amp;
Noble Nook Tablet 8GB. For context, you can read my original thread
"<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1529553">Root for Nook
Tablet 8GB (w/ Android Market)</a> on XDA-Developers where I published my rooting
method, which has reached a download count of&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;wait for it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;OVER NINE
THOUSAND!!!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For an overview of how rooting works behind the scenes, you may want to read my
previous article
<a href="/posts/how-rooting-works-a-technical-explanation-of-the-android-rooting-process.html">How
Rooting Works - A Technical Explanation of the Android Rooting Process</a> as
background.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sometime in late February (2012), on a visit to to a Barnes &amp; Noble store in
Boston, I bought the then freshly released Nook Tablet 8GB entirely on impulse
for $199. Being the hax0r that I am, the first thing I did when I got home was
to try to root the device. It came as a nasty surprise, therefore, when I
discovered that no one had yet succeeded in rooting the device. All I could find
was a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8e0OLWQYc4">YouTube video</a> showing
that the existing rooting method for its cousin, the Nook Tablet 16GB, did not
work. After waiting for a few days, the absolutely pathetic app store and
handicaps instituted by B&amp;N finally motivated me to develop a rooting method for
the device myself.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_plan">The Plan</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, how do you go about rooting an Android device? As I explain in
<a href="/posts/how-rooting-works-a-technical-explanation-of-the-android-rooting-process.html">my
previous article</a>, rooting is basically a two-step process:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Find exploit that allows execution of arbitrary code as root
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use exploit to install <code>su</code> (with SUID bit set) and <code>Superuser.apk</code> as root
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After <code>su</code> and <code>Superuser.apk</code> are installed correctly, apps that require root
(such as <a href="http://matrixrewriter.com/android/">Titanium Backup</a> or
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adaway&amp;hl=en">AdAway</a>)
will invoke <code>su</code> to run code as the privileged user.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_process">The Process</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are many generic or device-specific exploits that a hax0r may leverage to
achieve privileged execution of arbitrary code. I would again refer you to
<a href="http://jon.oberheide.org/files/bsides11-dontrootrobots.pdf">this excellent
presentation on various Android root exploits</a> that have been or may still be
used for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, none of these methods that I knew of could work on the Nook Tablet,
which is probably one of the most locked-down Android ROMs out there:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Bootloader is locked.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ADB is disabled, and cannot be enabled from the UI.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Installing non-market apps (raw APKs) is disabled, and cannot be enabled from the UI.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No access to Google Play / Android Market (or any Google Apps).
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This rules out 1) root APKs and 2) the majority of exploits out there that
require executing commands over ADB. It means that one cannot run any code on
the device that does not come from B&amp;N period.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But of course there was another way in. Somebody on XDA-Developers had
discovered that the bootloader of the Nook Tablet supported booting off an
Android system located in partition images stored on an external microSD card.
This mechanism is probably used to repair corrupted system partitions by B&amp;N
customer support.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The solution, then, is clear: we create dummy system partition images that,
instead of booting an Android system, installs <code>su</code> and <code>Superuser.apk</code> into the
"normal" Android system in internal flash memory. More concretely, I modified
the system initialization file inside the initrd inside the boot partition image
to invoke a custom script that copied the relevant files into the <code>system</code>
partition in the internal flash memory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I based my work on
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1517513">bauwks&#8217;s 2nduboot
images</a> and used <a href="https://gitorious.org/ac100/abootimg">abootimg</a> to unpack
files in the boot partition image <code>boot.img</code>:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Extracts files in the boot partition image into the current directory.</span>
abootimg -x ./boot.img
<span class="c"># Extract files in the initrd cpio archive into the folder ./ramdisk/</span>
aboot-unpack-initrd ./initrd.img
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I changed the system initialization file <code>init.omap4430.rc</code> in the initrd to
mount the system partition of the internal flash memory at <code>/foo</code> rather than
<code>/system</code>, because later system initialization steps attempt to remount
<code>/system</code> as read-only and so on, and for some reason I could not disable that
behavior:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>on fs
    mkdir /foo
    mount ext4 /dev/block/platform/mmci-omap-hs.1/by-name/system /foo wait</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I added the following to the system initialization file <code>init.rc</code> in the initrd to start my rooting script:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>service root_script /sbin/busybox ash /assets/run.sh
    oneshot</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>My rooting script, which I place in the directory <code>assets</code> in the initrd,
installs not only <code>su</code>, but also Google Play and other Google apps which are
missing from the Nook Tablet ROM:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Install su and Superuser.apk</span>
/sbin/busybox cp /assets/su /foo/bin/
/sbin/busybox cp /assets/su /foo/xbin/
/sbin/busybox chmod <span class="m">06755</span> /foo/xbin/su
/sbin/busybox chmod <span class="m">06755</span> /foo/bin/su
/sbin/busybox cp /assets/Superuser.apk /foo/app/

<span class="c"># Install Busybox.</span>
/sbin/busybox cp /sbin/busybox /foo/xbin/
/sbin/busybox chmod <span class="m">06755</span> /foo/xbin/busybox

<span class="c"># Install Google Play and other Google apps.</span>
/sbin/busybox cp /assets/*.apk /foo/app/
/sbin/busybox cp /assets/com.google.android.maps..xml /foo/etc/permissions/
/sbin/busybox cp /assets/com.google.android.maps.jar /foo/framework/
/sbin/busybox cp /assets/libvoicesearch.so /foo/lib/

<span class="c"># Done.</span>
/sbin/busybox mount -o ro,remount /foo
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In accordance with the above script, I had placed all assets in the <code>assets</code>
directory inside the initrd, and the Busybox binary in <code>sbin</code> inside the initrd.
With all changes done, I pack everything back into a new boot.img:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Build initrd cpio archive</span>
abootimg-pack-initrd initrd.img.new
<span class="c"># Build new boot.img using previously extracted components</span>
abootimg --create boot.img.new -f ./bootimg.cfg -k ./zImage -r ./initrd.img.new
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then I replace the <code>boot.img</code> on the SD card image with my <code>boot.img.new</code>, and
the rooting method is done.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_final_words">Final words</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The actual process, of course, was much, much more painful. The Nook Tablet&#8217;s
bootloader is very picky; some microSD cards just won&#8217;t work, there is a file
size limit on <code>boot.img</code>, etc.. It was also after much frustration that I
discovered the mount-to-<code>/foo</code> trick. And I could not even keep track of how
many factory restores I had to perform on the device to undo bad modifications.
But it was still a lot of fun, and the euphoria at the end and the feeling of
accomplishment when reply posts started rolling in and random people were
donating $5 as a token of their appreciation could not be overstated.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Good luck rooting!</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody" class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>Have you ever wondered how CDMA phones are programmed to a specific carrier for
voice calls, SMS and data?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the U.S., all major CDMA carriers operate on the same frequencies, which
means that there is no inherent difference in hardware between phones sold by
any of them, and that theoretically there is no reason why a Verizon Wireless
phone cannot work on Sprint or MetroPCS or Virgin Mobile or Boost Mobile, for
example. Unlike GSM phones with swappable SIM&#8217;s, however, a CDMA phone sold in
the U.S. is typically locked to a particular carrier; so how is that done?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I was recently able to figure out the answer to this question when I
successfully flashed a CDMA phone from Sprint to Verizon (an exploit I may
document separately some day). As I have not been able to find a compilation of
this information elsewhere, I am writing up this document in the hope that it
will help others with flashing phones or porting ROMs to different carriers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that this information is based on my research with the Jelly Bean (4.1 &amp;
4.2), ICS (4.0) and Gingerbread (2.3.4) versions of Android and two major U.S.
CDMA carriers, Verizon Wireless and Sprint. Hence, it may not be applicable to
other phones or carriers; in particular, the section about CDMA chips do not
apply to CDMA phones that require a SIM card, such as some Verizon Wireless LTE
phones. In such cases, your comments and insights are welcome.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, a disclaimer: I have no formal understanding of any of the intricacies
of CDMA technology and therefore cannot guarantee the correctness or accuracy of
this information. Use it at your own risk. I cannot be held responsible for any
damage or legal consequences resulting from or related to the application of
this information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At a high level, there are two places where carrier information is stored on a
CDMA Android phone: inside the CDMA chip (radio), and in Android OS system
files.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_programming_the_cdma_chip">Programming the CDMA chip</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Every CDMA phone (obviously) has a CDMA chip (radio). This chip is responsible
for carrying out voice calls and transferring data over 2G/3G, and in order to
do that, it needs to know stuff like what phone number it represents, what
towers to connect to, what account name to bill the 3G connection to, etc.. All
of this information is stored directly inside the chip (unless you have a
Verizon Wireless LTE phone with a SIM card), and not on any file system
controlled by the OS; this is why even after a factory reset (which formats the
internal flash file system) these settings persist. It is (I believe) not
possible to change the information stored on the CDMA chip from the OS itself;
instead, carriers provide a special number (e.g., *228 for Verizon Wireless)
that, when called, will transfer the information to the chip. This is typically
called "programming" the phone by U.S. carriers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So what information exactly is stored inside the CDMA chip? Here&#8217;s an incomplete
list:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>MEID</strong>: Unique serial number of the phone. This is like the MAC address of an
  ethernet / WiFi card in that it is the sole identifier of the CDMA chip. It is
  what carriers use to connect phone calls, deliver SMS&#8217;s, blacklist stolen
  phones, etc.. A fatal flaw, however, is that it is actually possible to modify
  (flash) the MEID of many, but not all, CDMA chips. If you flash the MEID of
  phone A onto phone B, the carrier network has no way of distinguishing between
  phone A and phone B, and phone B is able to make and receive calls, send and
  receive messages etc. as phone A. Unsurprisingly, this is illegal in many
  countries, including the U.S., and as such I will not discuss it here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Phone / account numbers</strong>: known as MDN and MIN, these store the phone and
  account numbers associated with the phone.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>2G/3G data account information</strong>: user names and passwords used to connect to
  data services. Some carriers have stronger (harder to impersonate)
  authentication systems than others; for instance, Verizon Wireless requires
  two encrypted passwords and a secret key in the EFS file system on the CDMA
  chip; Boost Mobile only requires two passwords; while MetroPCS simply accepts
  the SPC/MSL code (see below) as the password. Note that 2G and 3G are
  unrelated systems with independent authentication; a phone can have valid 3G
  credentials and thus connect to 3G while being denied a 2G connection.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>PRL (Preferred Roaming List)</strong>: a list of towers the phone can connect to. This
  is of course carrier- and location-specific. In some cases, updating the PRL
  (by calling a special number) can improve reception and save battery when the
  phone moves to a new geographical area; see
  <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/care/popups/prl.html">Verizon Wireless&#8217;s
  explanation</a>, for example.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Software such as CDMA Workshop, DFS, QXDM/QPST can be used to read / write
information stored on a CDMA chip from a computer. Often, however, a 6-digit
passcode known as the SPC code or the MSL code is required. This SPC/MSL code,
again stored inside the CDMA chip, is either randomly assigned by the carrier
(this is the case for Verizon Wireless and Sprint) or deterministically computed
based on the MEID (MetroPCS). In the former case, there are a variety of tricks
for retrieving the SPC/MSL code from the phone itself,; Google is your friend
there. In the latter case, there are sites for computing the code from the MEID.
Once it is known, the SPC/MSL code can be changed to any 6-digit number; some
phones may even allow you to overwrite the SPC/MSL code without knowing it
first.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_carrier_configuration_in_the_android_os">Carrier configuration in the Android OS</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To figure out what system files in the Android OS contain carrier information, I
inspected source code and images of ROMS for the Samsung Galaxy Nexus (Sprint
and Verizon Wireless), the Samsung Nexus S 4G (Sprint), the HTC Incredible
(Verizon Wireless), and the Motorola Droid 3 (Verizon Wireless). I found three
places that store carrier-specific information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first is <code>/system/build.prop</code>. Sprint phones contain the following lines:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>ro.cdma.home.operator.numeric=310120
ro.cdma.home.operator.alpha=Sprint</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>while Verizon Wireless phones contain the following lines instead:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>ro.cdma.home.operator.numeric=310004
ro.cdma.home.operator.alpha=Verizon
ro.cdma.homesystem=64,65,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These settings apply to phone calls. If one adopts the Sprint configuration on a
Verizon Wireless phone, for example, the phone would ring very briefly on a
call, but would be unable to actually make or receive calls. The
<code>ro.cdma.homesystem</code> specifies a list of indices into the PRL that represent
"home" or non-roaming networks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The second configuration file is <code>eri.xml</code>, which is compiled into the file
<code>/res/xml/eri.xml</code> inside the system package
<code>/system/framework/framework-res.apk</code> on an Android system. This file tells the
OS what it needs to display about a particular network (as an index into the
PRL); for an example, take a look at
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/device/samsung/toroplus/<code>/refs/tags/android-4.2_r1/overlay/frameworks/base/core/res/res/xml/eri.xml">the
stock +eri.xml</code> for the Sprint Galaxy Nexus</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_device_samsung_toro/blob/ics/overlay/frameworks/base/core/res/res/xml/eri.xml">the
CyanogenMod <code>eri.xml</code> for the Verizon Wireless Galaxy Nexus</a>. In particular,
this file instructs the OS whether to consider a network (tower) to be roaming
(so whether a roaming icon is displayed), and gives the name of the network
(tower) to be shown in the UI. It must be stressed that this file <em>has no
functional effect</em>; all it changes is how the OS displays information about
networks. Since APK packages are just ZIP archives, it is easy to replace the
<code>eri.xml</code> within to change roaming and name settings for networks; note,
however, that the file inside the APK is not a plain text XML, but some compiled
binary form; you may need to Google for the appropriate binary form pulled from
another phone.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The last configuration file is <code>/system/etc/apns-conf.xml</code>. This file contains
APN settings for 4G and MMS. See the stock APN settings file for the
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/device/samsung/crespo4g/+/refs/heads/jb-release/4g-apns-conf.xml">Sprint
Nexus S 4G</a> or the
<a href="https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_vendor_cm/blob/ics/prebuilt/common/etc/apns-conf-cdma.xml">default
CyanogenMod APN settings</a>.</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody" class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>While working on a port of the Gingerbread (2.3.7) userland of Android for the N810, I had to figure out how to add support for an audio chip with a working ALSA driver in an Android build. The information was out there but it took me a while to figure everything out, so here&#8217;s a brief summary of the process.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First, of course, ALSA drivers for the chip must be enabled in the kernel; to check whether they are working, see if <code>/dev/snd</code> is properly populated. If not, check if the driver has been compiled into the kernel and not as a module.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are three libraries that act as intermediate layers between an ALSA sound device and the Android userland. Due to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-building/msg/c73c14f9b0dcd15a?pli=1">the recent relocation of the Android source tree</a>, I used alternative URLs for the three libraries. The code (shamelessly stolen and modified from <a href="http://www.armadeus.com/wiki/index.php?title=Android#Audio">this Armadeus Wiki page</a>) is as follows, assuming <code>$ANDROID_SOURCE</code> points to the root of the checked-out Android source tree:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$ANDROID_SOURCE</span>/external

<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$ANDROID_SOURCE</span>/hardware
git clone git://git.omapzoom.org/platform/hardware/alsa_sound.git
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, a bogus commit to the last library in <code>platform/hardware/alsa_sound</code> breaks the build (as explained <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.android.porting/15792">in this thread</a>), hence:</p></div>

I have always been curious how rooting actually worked behind the scenes. After
recently acquiring a new Eee Pad Slider, a Honeycomb tablet that so far no one
has been able to root, the frustration of being locked out of this amazing piece
of hardware with so much potential led me to finally sit down and figure out
what exactly rooting means, what it entails from a technical perspective, and
how hackers out in the wild are approaching the rooting of a new device.
Although all this information is out there, I have not been able to find a good
article that had both the level of technical detail that I wanted and an
appropriate introduction to the big picture, and so I decided to write my own.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is NOT a noob-friendly guide to rooting a particular Android device.
Rather, it is a general explanation of how stock Android ROMs try to prevent
unprivileged access, how hackers attack this problem and how rooting software
leverage various exploits to defeat these security mechanisms.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_i_the_goal">I. The Goal</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let us first take a step back and consider <em>exactly</em> what we mean by rooting.
Forget flashing custom ROMs, enabling WiFi tethering or installing
Superuser.apk; fundamentally, rooting is about obtaining root access to the
underlying Linux system beneath Android and thus gaining absolute control over
the software that is running on the device. Things that require root access on a
typical Linux system&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;mounting and unmounting file systems, starting your
favorite SSH or HTTP or DHCP or DNS or proxy servers, killing system processes,
chroot-ing, etc.,&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;require root access on Android as well. Being able to run
arbitrary commands as the root user allows you to do absolutely <em>anything</em> on a
Linux / Android system, and this is real goal of rooting.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Stock OEM Android builds typically do not allow users to execute arbitrary code
as root. This essentially means that you as a user are granted only limited
control over your own device; you can make your device do task <em>X</em> only if the
manufacturer explicitly decided to allow it and shipped a program to do it.  You
will not be able to use third-party apps to accomplish a task that your
manufacturer does not wish you to do. WiFi tethering is a good example of this.
Cell phone carriers obviously do not want you to tether your phone without
paying them additional charges. Therefore, many phones come pre-packaged with
their own proprietary WiFi tethering apps that demand extraneous fees. But
without root access, you will not be able to install a free alternative like
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/"> Wireless Tether For Root
Users</a>. Why this is accepted practice in the industry is a mystery to me.  The
only difference between cell phones, tablets and computers is their form factor;
but while a PC vendor would fail spectacularly if they tried to prevent users
from running arbitrary programs on their machines, cell phone vendors are
clearly not judged along the same lines. But such arguments would belong to
another article.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ii_the_enemy_protection_mechanisms_on_a_stock_oem_android_rom">II. The Enemy: Protection Mechanisms On A Stock OEM Android ROM</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_1_bootloader_and_recovery">1. Bootloader and Recovery</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The bootloader, the first piece of code executed when your device is powered on,
is responsible for loading the Android OS and the recovery system and flashing a
new ROM. People refer to some bootloaders as "unlocked" if a user can flash and
boot arbitrary ROMs without hacking; unfortunately, many Android devices have
locked bootloaders that you would have to hack around in order to make them do
anything other than boot the stock ROM. A Samsung smartphone I had used some
months ago had an unlocked bootloader; I could press a certain combination of
hardware keys on the phone, connect it to my computer, and flash any custom ROM
onto it using Samsung&#8217;s utilities without having to circumvent any protection
mechanisms. The same is not true for my Motorola Droid 2 Global; the bootloader,
as far as I know, cannot be hacked. The Eee Pad Slider, on the other hand, is an
interesting beast; as with other nVidia Tegra 2 based devices, its bootloader is
controllable through the <code>nvflash</code> utility, but only if you know the <em>secure
boot key</em> (SBK) of the device.  (The SBK is a private AES key used to encrypt
the commands sent to the bootloader; the bootloader will only accept the command
if it has been encrypted by the particular key of the device.) Currently, as the
SBK of the Eee Pad Slider is not publicly known, the bootloader remains
inaccessible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>System recovery is the second piece of low-level code on board any Android
device. It is separate from the Android userland and is typically located on its
own partition; it is usually booted by the bootloader when you press a certain
combination of hardware keys. It is important to understand that it is a totally
independent program; Linux and the Android userland is not loaded when you boot
into recovery, and any high-level concept such as root does not exist here. It
is simple program that really is a very primitive OS, and it has absolute
control over the system and will do anything you want as long as the code to do
it is built in. Stock recovery varies with the manufacturer, but often includes
functionalities like reformatting the <code>/data</code> partition (factory reset) and
flashing an update ROM (<code>update.zip</code>, located at the root of the external
microSD card) signed by the manufacturer.  Note I said <em>signed by the
manufacturer</em>; typically it is not possible to flash custom update files unless
you obtain the private key of the manufacturer and sign your custom update with
it, which is both impossible for most and illegal under certain jurisdictions.
However, since recovery is stored in a partition just like <code>/system</code>, <code>/data</code>
and <code>/cache</code> (more about that later), you can replace it with a custom recovery
if you have root access in Linux / Android.  Most people do just that upon
rooting their device; <a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com/">ClockworkMod Recovery</a>
is a popular third-party recovery image, and allows you to flash arbitrary ROMs,
backup and restore partitions, and lots of other magic.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2_adb">2. ADB</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>ADB (see
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html">the official documentation for ADB</a>)
allows a PC or a Mac to connect to an Android device and perform certain
operations. One such operation is to launch a simple shell on the device, using
the command <code>adb shell</code>. The real question is what user do the commands executed
by that shell process run as. It turns out that it depends on the value of an
Android system property, named <code>ro.secure</code>. (You can view the value of this
property by typing <code>getprop ro.secure</code> either through an ADB shell or on a
terminal emulator on the device.) If <code>ro.secure=0</code>, an ADB shell will run
commands as the root user on the device. But if <code>ro.secure=1</code>, an ADB shell will
run commands as an unprivileged user on the device. Guess what <code>ro.secure</code> is
set to on almost every stock OEM Android build. But can we change the value of
<code>ro.secure</code> on a system? The answer is no, as implied by the <code>ro</code> in the name of
the property. The value of this property is set at boot time from the
<code>default.prop</code> file in the root directory. The contents of the root directory
are essentially <em>copied</em> from a partition in the internal storage on boot, but
you cannot write to the partition if you are not already root. In other words,
this property denies root access via ADB, and the only way you could change it
is by gaining root access in the first place. Thus, it is secure.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_3_android_ui">3. Android UI</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On an Android system, all Android applications that you can see or interact with
directly are running as _un_privileged users in sandboxes. Logically, a program
running as an unprivileged user cannot start another program that is run as the
privileged user; otherwise any program can simply start another copy of itself
in privileged mode and gain privileged access to everything. On the other hand,
a program running as root can start another program as root or as an
unprivileged user. On Linux, privilege escalation is usually accomplished via
the <code>su</code> and <code>sudo</code> programs; they are often the only programs in the system
that are able to execute the system call <code>setuid(0)</code> that changes the current
program from running as an unprivileged user to running as root.  Apps that
label themselves as requiring root are in reality just executing other programs
(often just native binaries packaged with the app) through <code>su</code>. Unsurprisingly,
stock OEM ROMs never come with these <code>su</code>. You cannot just download it or copy
it over either; it needs to have its SUID bit set, which indicates to the system
that the programs this allowed to escalate its runtime privileges to root. But
of course, if you are not root, you cannot set the SUID bit on a program. To
summarize, what this means is that any program that you can interact with on
Android (and hence running in unprivileged mode) is unable to either 1) gain
privileged access and execute in privileged mode, or 2) start another program
that executes in privileged mode.  If this holds, the Android system by itself
is pretty much immune to privilege escalation attempts. We will see the loophole
exploited by on-device rooting applications in the next section.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_iii_fighting_the_system">III. Fighting the System</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So how the hell do you root an Android? Well, from the security mechanisms
described above, we can figure out how to attack each component in turn.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your device happens to have an unlocked bootloader, you&#8217;re pretty much done.
An example is the Samsung phone that I had had. Since the bootloader allowed the
flashing of arbitrary ROMs, somebody essentially pulled the stock ROM from the
phone (using <code>dd</code>), added <code>su</code>, and repackaged it into a modified ROM. All I as
a user needed to do was to power off the phone, press a certain combination of
hardware keys to start the phone in flashing mode, and use Samsung&#8217;s utilities
to flash the modified ROM onto the phone.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Believe it or not, certain manufacturers don&#8217;t actually set <code>ro.secure</code> to 1. If
that is the case, rooting is even easier; just plug the phone into your computer
and run ADB, and you now have a shell that can execute any program as root. You
can then mount <code>/system</code> as read-write, install <code>su</code> and all your dreams have
come true.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But many other Android devices have locked bootloaders and <code>ro.secure</code> set. As
explained above, they should not be root-able because you can only interact with
unprivileged programs on the system and they cannot help you execute any
privileged code. So what&#8217;s the solution?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We know that a number of important programs, including low-level system
services, must run as root even on Android in order to access hardware
resources. Typing <code>ps</code> on an Android shell (either via ADB or a terminal
emulator on the device) will give you an idea. These programs are started by the
<code>init</code> process, the first process started by the kernel (I often feel that the
kernel and the <code>init</code> process are kind of analogous to Adam and Eve&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the
kernel spawns <code>init</code> in a particular fashion, and <code>init</code> then goes on and spawns
all other processes) which has to run as root because it needs to start other
privileged system processes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now here&#8217;s the key insight: if you can hack / trick one of these system
processes running in privileged mode to execute your arbitrary code, you have
just gained privileged access to the system. This how all one-click-root methods
work, including z4root, gingerbreak, and so on. If you are truly curious, I
highly recommend
<a href="http://jon.oberheide.org/files/bsides11-dontrootrobots.pdf">this excellent
presentation on the various exploits used by current rooting tools</a>, but the
details are not as relevant here as the simple idea behind them. That idea is
that there are vulnerabilities in the system processes running as root in the
background that, if exploited, will allow us to execute arbitrary code as root.
Well, that "arbitrary code" is most certainly a piece of code that mounts
<code>/system</code> in read-write mode and installs a copy of <code>su</code> permanently on the
system, so that from then on we don&#8217;t need to jump through the hoops to run the
programs we really wanted to run in the first place.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since Android is open source as is Linux, what people have done is to scrutinize
and reason about the source code of the various system services until they find
a security hole they can leverage. This becomes increasingly hard as Google and
the maintainers of the various pieces of code fix those particular
vulnerabilities when they are discovered and published, which means that the
exploits will eventually become obsolete with newer devices. But the good news
is that manufacturers are not stupid enough to push OTA updates to fix a
vulnerability just to prevent rooting as it is very expensive for them; in
addition, devices in the market are always lagging behind the newest software
releases. Thus, it takes quite some time before these rooting tools are rendered
useless by new patches, and by then hopefully other exploits would have been
discovered.</p></div>
