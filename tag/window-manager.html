    <div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="/posts/how-x-window-managers-work-and-how-to-write-one-part-i.html">Part
I of this series</a>, we examined the role of X window managers on a modern
Linux/BSD desktop, and how they interact with the X server and applications. In
Part II, we will dig down into the dirty details and walk through the code of a
basic reparenting, non-compositing window manager,
<a href="https://github.com/jichuan89/basic_wm">basic_wm</a>.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_introduction">Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before we start with the code, let&#8217;s go over a couple of basic implementation
choices such as language and API.</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_language">Language</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can write a window manager in <a href="http://xmonad.org">Haskell</a>,
<a href="http://qtile.org">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/stumpwm/">Lisp</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/wingo">Go</a>,
<a href="http://escher.sourceforge.net/">Java</a>, or any other language that has X bindings
- i.e., a library for talking to an X server.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I chose C++ for <a href="https://github.com/jichuan89/basic_wm">basic_wm</a>, our example
window manager, mainly because the C libraries for X11 are the best documented.
In addition to books such as the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Manual-Version-Definitive-Guides/dp/1565920023">Xlib
Programming Manual</a>, documentation can be found in the form of widely available
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/current/manindex3.html">man pages</a> (e.g., try <code>man
XOpenDisplay</code> at a terminal). Example usage and common patterns abound in the
source code of many great window managers written in the past three decades.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We will use C++11 and C++14 features where convenient, so you will need a
compatible compiler (GCC 4.9 or higher, or Clang 3.4 or higher) if you want to
play with the source code.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="a-tale-of-two-x-libraries">A Tale of Two X Libraries</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are two official C libraries for X:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib">Xlib</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcb">XCB</a>. Xlib, hailing from 1985, was the original
X client library, and was the only official X client library until the
introduction of XCB in 2001. The two libraries have very different philosophies:
whereas Xlib tries to hide the X protocol behind a friendly C API with lots of
bells and whistles, XCB directly exposes the plumbing beneath.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In practice, this different manifests itself most prominently in how the two
libraries handle the fundamental asynchronous nature of the X protocol. Xlib
attempts to hide the asynchronous X protocol behind a mixed
synchronous and asynchronous API, whereas XCB is fully asynchronous.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, to lookup the attributes (e.g., size and position) of a window, you
would write the following using Xlib:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">XWindowAttributes</span> <span class="n">attrs</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">XGetWindowAttributes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">display</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">attrs</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// Do stuff.</span>
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Under the hood,
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man3/XGetWindowAttributes.3.html"><code>XGetWindowAttributes</code>()</a>
sends a request to the X server and blocks until it receives a response; in
other words, it is <em>synchronous</em>. On the other hand, using XCB, you would write
this instead:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kt">xcb_get_window_attributes_cookie_t</span> <span class="n">cookie</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="n">xcb_get_window_attributes</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">window</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// Do other stuff while waiting for reply.</span>
<span class="kt">xcb_get_window_attributes_reply_t</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">reply</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="n">xcb_get_window_attributes_reply</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cookie</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">nullptr</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// Do stuff.</span>
<span class="n">free</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">reply</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The function <code>xcb_get_window_attributes</code> merely sends the request to the X
server, and returns immediately without waiting for the reply; in other words,
it is <em>asynchronous</em>. The client program must subsequently call
<code>xcb_get_window_attributes_reply</code> to block on the response.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The advantage of the asynchronous approach is obvious if we consider an example
where we need to retrieve the attributes of, say, 5 windows. Using XCB, we can
fire off all 5 requests to the X server at once, and then wait for 5 responses.
With Xlib, we have to wait for the response to each request before we can send
the next one. Therefore, we only block for one round-trip network latency using
XCB, compared to 5 with Xlib.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The downside of XCB&#8217;s fully asynchronous approach is verbosity and a less
programmer-friendly API.  The Xlib code above looks like your average C library
call; the XCB code above is significantly more involved.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, it is important to note that whereas XCB is fully asynchronous, Xlib
isn&#8217;t fully synchronous; rather, <strong>Xlib has a mixture of synchronous and
asynchronous APIs</strong>. In general, functions that do not return values (e.g.,
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man3/XConfigureWindow.3.html">XResizeWindow</a>,
which changes the size of a window) are asynchronous, while functions that
return values (e.g.,
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man3/XGetWindowAttributes.3.html">XGetGeometry</a>,
which return the size and position of a window) are synchronous:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xlib saves up requests instead of sending them to the server immediately, so
that the client program can continue running instead of waiting to gain access
to the network after every Xlib call. This is possible because most Xlib calls
do not require immediate action by the server. This grouping of requests by the
client before sending them over the network also increases the performance of
most networks, because it makes the network transactions longer and less
numerous, reducing the total overhead involved.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xlib sends the buffer full of requests to the server under three conditions.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most common is when an application calls an Xlib routine to wait for an
event but no matching event is currently available on Xlib’s queue. Since, in
this case, the application must wait for an appropriate event anyway, it makes
sense to flush the request buffer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Second, Xlib calls that get information from the server require a reply before
the program can continue, and therefore, the request buffer is sent and all the
requests acted on before the information is returned.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Third, the client would like to be able to flush the request buffer manually in
situations where no user events and no calls to query the server are expected.
One good example of this third case is an animated game, where the display
changes even when there is no user input.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Xlib Programming Manual §2.1.2
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is <em>the</em> most confusing aspect of Xlib, and was a source of endless
frustration for those new to X programming. One of the major motivations for the
creation of XCB was to eliminate this unnecessary complexity.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Most popular window managers have already been ported to XCB from Xlib for the
performance benefits. (If you are interested, you can read up on
<a href="http://www.mini-dweeb.org/~arnau/docs/dueti/project/report.pdf">how they ported
Awesome</a> and
<a href="http://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2013/02/porting-kwin-to-xcb-making-c-usable-through-raii/">KWin</a>).
I chose Xlib for <a href="https://github.com/jichuan89/basic_wm">basic_wm</a>, however,
because for pedagogical example code readability is of course much more
important than performance. In fact, I would recommend starting with Xlib first
for any project and worry about porting to XCB later, as Xlib is much easier to
work with.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While an in-depth discussion of the merits of Xlib and XCB is beyond the scope
of this discussion, I do recommend you check out
<a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/guide/xlib-and-xcb/">the official article on Xlib vs. XCB</a>
as it presents a fascinating case study of API design.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dependencies_and_building">Dependencies and Building</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The only additional library used by the example
<a href="https://github.com/jichuan89/basic_wm">basic_wm</a> code is
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-glog/">google-glog</a>, Google&#8217;s open source C++
logging library. (It is available on Debian/Ubuntu as <code>libgoogle-glog-dev</code>, on
Fedora as <code>glog</code>, and on Arch Linux as <code>google-glog</code>.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The recommended way to build the source code is with
<a href="http://www.scons.org/">SCons</a>, although <code>g++ *.cpp</code> will also do the trick if you
supply all the libraries correctly.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To test it, you will likely need
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xephyr/">Xephyr</a> along with a couple of
simple X programs such as <code>xeyes</code> or <code>xterm</code>.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_step_1_setup_and_teardown">Step 1: Setup and Teardown</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s start off with a skeleton implementation of the <code>WindowManager</code> class,
which will encapsulate all the window management logic in our example. All it
will do for now is set up a connection to the X server on construction, and
close that connection on destruction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Even if you have never programmed Xlib before, this should not be hard to
understand. <code>WindowManager::Create()</code> is a
<a href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Doing_Work_in_Constructors">static
factory method</a> that sets up a connection to an X server via
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man3/XOpenDisplay.3.html"><code>XOpenDisplay()</code></a>;
we will let
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man3/XOpenDisplay.3.html"><code>XOpenDisplay()</code></a>
figure out which X server to connect to from the <code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable.
The connection is represented by the opaque <code>Display</code> structure. We call
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man3/XOpenDisplay.3.html"><code>XCloseDisplay()</code></a>
on the saved <code>Display*</code> in the destructor to close the connection.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The other function of note is
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man3/AllPlanes.3.html"><code>DefaultRootWindow()</code></a>,
which returns the default root window for a given X server. Technically, an X
server may have several root windows in some rare multihead setups, but let&#8217;s
not worry about that here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you run this program now, it should connect to the X server, close the
connection, and exit. Hooray!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We first select substructure redirection and substructure notify events on the

<a href="/posts/how-x-window-managers-work-and-how-to-write-one-part-i.html#substructure-redirection">Substructure
Redirection</a> section in Part I; to recap, this allows the window manager to
intercept requests from top level windows, and subscribe to events concerning the
same. Only one X client can select substructure redirection on the root window
at any given time; the second client to attempt to do so will get a <code>BadAccess</code>
error.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Catching this error is somewhat tricky, however.
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man3/XSelectInput.3.html"><code>XSelectInput</code></a>,
like most Xlib functions, does not actually send a request to the X server, but
instead only <em>queues</em> the request and returns. Hence, we have to explicitly
flush the request queue with
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man3/XSync.3.html"><code>XSync</code></a> (see our
discussion above in <a href="#a-tale-of-two-x-libraries">A Tale of Two X Libraries</a>).
We set up a temporary error handler to catch errors.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Next, we set up our regular error handler which will be invoked for any future
errors.  Our implementation, which logs the error and continues, will be an
important debugging aid as we implement and test our window manager. I will not
show it here for the sake of brevity; for reference, check it out in

dispatch it to the appropriate handlers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The structure of the <code>XEvent</code> type is typical of a polymorphic C structure.
Each type of event carries different attributes and corresponds to an event

<div class="paragraph"><p>This way, the type is always available regardless of the type of event and
requires no additional storage. This, of course, is essentially C++ object
inheritance, and the same pattern can be observed in

<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/structures.html">Python&#8217;s C API</a>, and many other
object-oriented C APIs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In <code>basic_wm</code>, the event handlers follow the naming convention of <code>OnFoo()</code>,
where <code>Foo</code> is the type of the event, so it should be straightforward to figure
out who does what.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We now have a basic skeleton for our window manager, and we can start filling in
the meat - the event handlers. The million-dollar question is, what events does
a window manager handle, and what should it do with them?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the next installment of this series, we&#8217;ll answer that question by diving
into the complex ways window managers, clients and the user interact with each
other via X events. In the meantime, you&#8217;re more than welcome to check out the

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Window managers are one of the core components of the modern Linux/BSD desktop.
It is not an exaggeration to say that they define to a large degree our
day-to-day user experience, as they are responsible for deciding how individual
windows look, move around, react to input, and organize themselves. Hence,
almost 30 years since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrix_Window_Manager">the
first X window manager</a>, we still argue over the merits of different window
managers, and new window managers continue to reinvent how we interact with our
digital world.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this series of posts, I hope to demystify how window managers work, and how
you might go about writing one yourself.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I will be quoting quite heavily from the seminal
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Manual-Version-Definitive-Guides/dp/1565920023">Xlib
Programming Manual (3rd Ed, 1994)</a> by Adrian Nye and published by O&#8217;Reilly.
Despite its age, it remains amazingly relevant and is the best available
introductory text to the internals of X, which has not changed over the past two
decades as much as you&#8217;d think. Since you could buy the book plus shipping for
less than the price of a cup of coffee, I strongly recommend it to anyone
interested in learning more about X. In addition, its chapter 16 also covers the
basics of window management.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is in stark contrast to the integrative approach of other GUI systems. On
Mac OS X and <a href="https://unity.ubuntu.com/">Unity</a>, for example, an application could
not possibly function without the window manager, as the latter is responsible
for rendering a part of the application&#8217;s interface (e.g., menus).</p></div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_responsibilities_of_x_window_managers">The Responsibilities of X Window Managers</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you probably already know, X operates in a server-client model. An X <em>server</em>
controls one or more physical display devices as well as input devices (mouse,
keyboard, etc.). An application that wants to interact with these devices
assumes the role of an X <em>client</em>. An X server and its clients may run on the
same computer, in which case they communicate via
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">domain sockets</a>, or on different
computers, in which case they communicate through TCP/IP.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>A window manager is a regular X client.</strong> It doesn&#8217;t have any superuser
privileges or keys to kernel backdoors; it is a normal user process that is
allowed by the X server to call a set of special APIs. X ensures that no more
than one window manager is running at any given point by denying a client access
to these APIs if another client currently has access. The first client to
attempt to access these APIs always succeeds.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A window manager communicates with the windows it manages through two X
mechanisms: properties and events. We will discuss these in detail in later
sections, but the takeaway is that the communication happens through the X
server, not directly between the window manager and other applications.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is illustrated by the following diagram:</p></div>

<h3 id="_how_an_x_window_manager_manages_windows">How an X Window Manager Manages Windows</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s now dive into the details of how a window manager does its job.</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_window_hierarchy">The Window Hierarchy</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When we think about modern GUIs, we usually use the term <em>widgets</em> or <em>controls</em>
to refer to UI elements such as buttons, scrollbars, or text boxes, and the term
<em>windows</em> to refer to a container for such widgets that has its own name and
can be independently moved around, closed, resized, etc..</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>X, however, was designed to be as low-level as possible. The fundamental UI
model that X provides, upon which UI frameworks such as
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> and <a href="http://qt-project.org">Qt</a> are built, is that of an
<em>hierarchy of rectangles</em>. In X terminology, all top level windows, UI elements,
etc., are <em>windows</em>. A <em>window</em>, then, is any rectangular area that is an unit
of user interaction and/or graphic display.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Windows are organized into a tree hierarchy. At the root of the hierarchy is the
<em>root window</em>, a virtual, invisible window that has the same size as the screen,
and is always present. Top level windows are direct children of the root
window. UI elements within a top level window are descendants of that window.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><div align="center"><img src="/assets/files/wm_sample_dialog.png" alt="An
example X window" style="max-width: 402px; width: 100%;"></div></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, consider the dialog box above from the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a>
desktop environment. The entire dialog is an X <em>window</em>. Each UI element in the
dialog box - the magnifying glass icon, the text box, the green down arrow, the
Close and Launch buttons, and the icons int those buttons - is also an X
<em>window</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The whole dialog window is a child of the root window. The magnifying glass
icon, the text box, and the Close and Launch buttons are children of the dialog
window. The green down arrow is a child of the text box window, and the icons in
the Close and Launch buttons are children of those buttons respectively.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An important thing to note about X windows is that a child window is clipped to
the boundaries of its parent:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">A child may be positioned partially or completely outside its parent window, but
output to the child is displayed and input received only in the area where the
child overlaps with the parent.</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Xlib Programming Manual §2.2.2
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, if we increase the width of the text box in the dialog above by
2x without changing the size of the dialog box, the portion of the text box that
extends outside of the dialog box will become invisible, and clicking on it will
not send an event to the text box.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A window manager manages top level windows - that is, direct children of the
root window.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="substructure-redirection">Substructure Redirection</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the absence of a window manager, when an application wants to reconfigure a
window - move, resize, show/hide, etc. - its request is directly processed by
the X server, and that&#8217;s the end of that. A window manager, however, needs to
intercept these requests. For example, a window manager may need to know that a
new top level window has been created and displayed, in order to draw window
decorations around it. It may also need to know that an existing top level
window has been resized, in order to update the window decorations to reflect
the change.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A window manager can intercept such requests using a mechanism called
<em>substructure redirection</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is how substructure redirection works. Suppose we have a window <em>W</em>, which
has a child window <em>C</em>. If a program <em>M</em> registers for the substructure
redirection of some types of requests on <em>W</em>, a matching request to modify <em>C</em>
will <em>not</em> be executed by the X server.  Instead, the X server redirects this
request to the program <em>M</em>, which can do whatever it wants with the request,
including granting the request with modifications or denying the request. More
formally,</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">The <em>structure</em>, as the term is used here, is the location, size, stacking
order, border width, and mapping status of a window. The <em>substructure</em> is all
these statistics about the children of a particular window. This is the complete
set of information about screen layout that the window manager might need in
order to implement its policy. <em>Redirection</em> means that an event is sent to the
client selecting redirection (usually the window manager), and the original
structure−changing request is not executed.</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Xlib Programming Manual §16.2
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that only direct children of a window <em>W</em> is affected by substructure
redirection on <em>W</em>, not any windows further down the hierarchy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This gets interesting when we consider substructure redirection on the root
window:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">When the window manager selects <code>SubstructureRedirectMask</code> on the root window,
an attempt by any other client to change the configuration of any child of the
root window will fail. Instead an event describing the layout change request
will be sent to the window manager. The window manager then reads the event and
determines whether to honor the request, modify it, or deny it completely. If it
decides to honor the request, it calls the routine that the client called that
triggered the event with the same arguments. If it decides to modify the
request, it calls the same routine but with modified arguments.</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Xlib Programming Manual §16.2
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In other words, a window manager must register for substructure redirection on
the root window, which causes all creation, destruction, reconfiguration etc. of
top level windows - which are direct children of the root window - to be routed
to the window manager. This is the magic hook into the X server that window
managers rely on to do their job.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This relationship is shown in the following diagram:
<div align="center"><img
src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ykdjiN-__H5-aWjic73c23K6g2MguBKLgwh9C2n-I5k/pub?w=602&amp;h=273"
alt="Role of a Window Manager"
style="max-width: 602px; width: 100%;"></div></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, the X server only allows one running program to register for
substructure redirection on any given window at any given time. An attempt to
register for substructure redirection on a window will fail if another X client
has already done the same on the same window, and has not unregistered,
disconnected from the X server, or crashed. Since all window managers must
register for substructure redirection on the root window, this latter acts as a
locking mechanism that prevents two or more window managers from running
simultaneously on the same screen.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_reparenting">Reparenting</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the example dialog box above, we see a title bar with, for example, little
buttons for closing, maximizing, and minimizing the window. These UI elements
are not created by the application, but by the window manager, via a process
known as <em>reparenting</em> or <em>framing</em>:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph"><p>A window manager can decorate [top level] windows on the screen with titlebars
and place little boxes on the titlebar with which the window can be moved or
resized. This is only one possibility [&#8230;].</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To do this, the window manager creates a child of the root somewhat larger than
the top level window of the application. Then it calls
<a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man3/XReparentWindow.3.html"><code>XReparentWindow()</code></a>,
specifying the top level window of the application as <code><em>win</em></code> and the new parent
[window it just created] as <code><em>parent</em></code>. <code><em>win</em></code> and all its descendants will
then be descendants of <code><em>parent</em></code>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Xlib Programming Manual §16.3
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In other words, if we were to run an X application without a window manager
present, the top level window of the application would be a direct child of the
root window. With a window manager running, however, the top level window of the
application may be <em>reparented</em> by the window manager; it becomes a child of a
frame window which is created by the window manager, and which is itself a child
of the root window. The window manager can add other UI elements inside this
frame window alongside the application&#8217;s top level window as it sees fit.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Therefore, I had lied to you just now: the dialog box above is actually a child
of a frame created by <a href="http://www.xfce.org">Xfce</a>'s window manager, Xfwm, along
with the other UI elements for window management.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Reparenting is what allows different window managers to draw different window
decorations, and thereby achieve a consistent look-and-feel across windows.
However, there are also window managers that do <em>not</em> reparent at all: these are
called <em>non-reparenting</em> window managers. There are two reasons why a window
manager would not want to reparent:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
If a window manager does not draw window decorations around top level
   windows , it obviously has no need to reparent them. Examples:
   <a href="http://xmonad.org">xmonad</a>, <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Compositing window managers do not always need to reparent windows; we will
   discuss why below. Example: <a href="http://www.compiz.org/">Compiz</a>. This is not true
   for all compositing window managers, however; for example, GNOME&#8217;s default
   window manager, <a href="http://github.com/GNOME/mutter/">Mutter</a>, is a reparenting
   comopositing window manager.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s now consider substructure redirection in the context of reparenting. When
a top level window <em>W</em> is first shown (<em>map</em>'ped in X jargon), the window manager
is notified because it has registered for substructure redirection on the root
window, and a top level window is a direct child of the root window. It then
creates a frame <em>F</em> and reparents <em>W</em>, so that <em>W</em> becomes a child of <em>F</em>, which
itself is a child of the root window. But since now <em>W</em> is no longer a direct
child of the root window, the window manager will no longer be able to intercept
changes to <em>W</em>!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Therefore, a reparenting window manager must also register for substructure
redirection on the frames it creates.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_compositing">Compositing</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Compositing window managers are a relatively new development. Compositing
support in X  was added in late 2004, a full decade after the last edition of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Manual-Version-Definitive-Guides/dp/1565920023">Xlib
Programming Manual</a>. The first compositing window managers,
<a href="http://www.xfce.org">Xfwm</a> and <a href="http://www.compiz.org/">Compiz</a>, launched in early
2005.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, what exactly does a compositing window manager do?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In our discussion above on substructure redirection and reparenting, we saw how
a window manager can respond to various requests for a top level window - to
display/hide it (<em>map</em>/<em>unmap</em> in X jargon), to resize it, to move it, etc.. But
we didn&#8217;t talk about how to deal with what&#8217;s <em>inside</em> the top level windows.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Indeed, from the perspective of the window manager, top level windows are black
boxes; they each manage their own descendant windows (UI elements), perhaps
through a framework such as <a href="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+</a> or
<a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a>, and the window manager has no right to interfere
there. The application that creates a top level window is responsible for
rendering and handling events for any descendant windows (UI elements), and does
so directly through X. This is shown in <a href="#role-of-a-window-manager">the first graph above</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As the computing power of graphics hardware grew, so did people&#8217;s expectations
from their window managers. With hardware acceleration, it became possible to
build much more computationally intensive user interfaces, such as the
(in)famous Desktop Cube in <a href="http://www.compiz.org">Compiz</a>:
<div align="center"><img src="/assets/files/wm_compiz.png"
style="max-width: 640px; width: 100%;"></div>
or the Shift Switcher:
<div align="center"><img src="/assets/files/wm_compiz_2.png"
style="max-width: 640px; width: 100%;"></div>
Let&#8217;s take a moment to think about how we can implement an interface such as the
Shift Switcher above. When the user triggers our wonderful interface, we need
to:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Render each top level window and all its descendant windows (UI elements) to
   an off-screen, in-memory buffer, instead of directly to the hardware.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Transform (rotate, contort, etc.) each buffer according to our design.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Composite the transformed buffers into a final buffer along with background
   and anything else we need to display.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Create an <em>overlay</em> window that covers the entire screen and hides all other
   windows.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Render the final buffer into the overlay window.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are a number of challenges:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
We must be able to retrieve the contents of top level windows. However, top
  level windows render directly through X.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We need to update our interface in real time as the contents of the
  top level windows change. However, top level windows render directly through
  X and do not notify window managers when their contents change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A top level window <em>A</em> may normally overlap with another top level window
  <em>B</em>, and thus a portion of <em>B</em> isn&#8217;t currently visible. Our interface,
  however, must capture the <em>full</em> rendering of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, regardless of
  overlapping regions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The compositing process is computationally intensive and requires hardware
  acceleration to function adequately.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is clear that none of this is possible without heavy cooperation from the X
server. Enter
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/compositeproto/tree/compositeproto.txt">the
Composite extension</a>:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">Many user interface operations would benefit from having pixel contents of
window hierarchies available without respect to sibling and antecedent clipping.
In addition, placing control over the composition of these pixel contents into a
final screen image in an external application will enable a flexible system for
dynamic application content presentation.</div>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; X Composite Extension
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Composite extension provides is a mechanism to request the X server not to
render a specific window and its descendants directly to hardware, but to a
special buffer maintained by the X server, and do so without the normal clipping
and overlap computations. This buffer can then be read and used by the client
that made the request.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In fact, that&#8217;s exactly what a compositing window manager does: it will ask X to
render each top level window to an off-screen, in-memory buffer and composite
the results into an overlay window. And it needs to do this not just for fancy
interfaces, but also to achieve effects like translucency, window animations,
soft shadows, and the like.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is illustrated in the following diagram:
<div align="center"><img
src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1eK05Uzlr2ix4NpsiEBUu42IwZ3DEjX8MvYTiE3-chqA/pub?w=573&amp;h=509"
style="max-width: 573px; width: 100%;"></div></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s end this section by considering whether a compositing window manager
should reparent top level windows.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since a compositing window manager knows the size and position of all top level
windows, it&#8217;s trivial for it to just draw window decorations during compositing
into the overlay window using graphics operations, without ever creating an
actual frame window and reparenting. Some compositing window managers do operate
this way.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the other hand, a window manager may need to support both a compositing and a
non-compositing mode, for compatibility with older or unsupported graphics
hardware. In this case, it needs to implement reparenting and frame windows for
non-compositing mode anyway, so additionally implementing drawing window
decorations using graphics operations becomes redundant. This is why some other
compositing window managers still choose to reparent.</p></div>
