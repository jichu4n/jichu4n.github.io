  <div itemprop="articleBody" class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>While working on a port of the Gingerbread (2.3.7) userland of Android for the N810, I had to figure out how to add support for an audio chip with a working ALSA driver in an Android build. The information was out there but it took me a while to figure everything out, so here&#8217;s a brief summary of the process.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First, of course, ALSA drivers for the chip must be enabled in the kernel; to check whether they are working, see if <code>/dev/snd</code> is properly populated. If not, check if the driver has been compiled into the kernel and not as a module.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are three libraries that act as intermediate layers between an ALSA sound device and the Android userland. Due to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-building/msg/c73c14f9b0dcd15a?pli=1">the recent relocation of the Android source tree</a>, I used alternative URLs for the three libraries. The code (shamelessly stolen and modified from <a href="http://www.armadeus.com/wiki/index.php?title=Android#Audio">this Armadeus Wiki page</a>) is as follows, assuming <code>$ANDROID_SOURCE</code> points to the root of the checked-out Android source tree:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$ANDROID_SOURCE</span>/external
git clone git://git.omapzoom.org/platform/external/alsa-lib.git
git clone git://git.omapzoom.org/platform/external/alsa-utils.git

<span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$ANDROID_SOURCE</span>/hardware
git clone git://git.omapzoom.org/platform/hardware/alsa_sound.git
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, a bogus commit to the last library in <code>platform/hardware/alsa_sound</code> breaks the build (as explained <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.android.porting/15792">in this thread</a>), hence:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="nv">$ANDROID_SOURCE</span>/hardware/alsa_sound
git checkout ece3f1b6f1e6a67d02e42490eca6c7de62220b57
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then, modify the <code>BoardConfig.mk</code> of your build to include:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">HAVE_HTC_AUDIO_DRIVER</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nb">false</span>
<span class="nv">BOARD_USES_GENERIC_AUDIO</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nb">false</span>
<span class="nv">BOARD_USES_ALSA_AUDIO</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
<span class="nv">BUILD_WITH_ALSA_UTILS</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
</pre></div></div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And that should do the trick.</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody" class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to the amazing comment by bhaskar on my previous post, I am glad to announce that the LM8323 keyboard is now functional in the 2.6.38 kernel after applying the threaded IRQ patch by Felipe and the level-triggered IRQ patch by Leigh found on <a href="http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.omap/58910">this thread on the LM8323</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I collected all the patches I used against the Android-OMAP 2.6.38 kernel at <a href="https://gitorious.org/nitdroid/kernel_patches">this new Git repository for NITDroid kernel patches</a> for better organization. I figured maintaining and working with patches was better than the entire kernel tree, and it also makes the changes easier for someone else to incorporate into their own kernel.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A recent problem I have had with this particular kernel is that it is not able to boot Maemo anymore, but fails with weird errors about watchdog processes. This is not a huge problem since I am much more interested in getting Android to work, but it does complicate my testing process as I am now no longer able to test the kernel with a known working user software stack. So before continuing with the kernel, I am going to resume working on the userland again, and see what I can get done there. In particular, I am going to try switching gears to Gingerbread, and see if I can get its userland to boot instead. From what I have been able to read the differences between the Froyo and Gingerbread userlands should not be so large as to cause serious porting issues. But we will see in the following weeks whether that is true.</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody" class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>I have made some progress with the 2.6.38 kernel on the Nokia N810. It now boots fine to the Android GUI:</p></div>

</a>
</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But unfortunately it&#8217;s still too early to celebrate. There is a very bizarre bug in my kernel: upon boot-up, the keyboard works fine, but after an indeterminate number of key presses, the keyboard stops working. Other input sources, such as the touchscreen, are not affected, while hardware buttons like the back, home and menu keys, which are attached to the same keyboard device (LM8323), stop functioning as well. I inserted debug statements into the keyboard driver and booted to the console to watch kernel messages as I pressed keys. I was very surprised to discover that after the first few key presses, not even the IRQ handler registered by the keyboard driver is invoked anymore. I do not see at all how that is even possible; I will need to investigate further next time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Incidentally, I also came across <a href="http://blogs.arm.com/software-enablement/498-from-zero-to-boot-porting-android-to-your-arm-platform/">this wonderful article on Android porting</a> from an engineer at ARM. It is the most detailed and well-written text on the subject that I have ever read. My approach does differ from the one described in the article though.</p></div>

I have always been curious how rooting actually worked behind the scenes. After
recently acquiring a new Eee Pad Slider, a Honeycomb tablet that so far no one
has been able to root, the frustration of being locked out of this amazing piece
of hardware with so much potential led me to finally sit down and figure out
what exactly rooting means, what it entails from a technical perspective, and
how hackers out in the wild are approaching the rooting of a new device.
Although all this information is out there, I have not been able to find a good
article that had both the level of technical detail that I wanted and an
appropriate introduction to the big picture, and so I decided to write my own.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is NOT a noob-friendly guide to rooting a particular Android device.
Rather, it is a general explanation of how stock Android ROMs try to prevent
unprivileged access, how hackers attack this problem and how rooting software
leverage various exploits to defeat these security mechanisms.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_i_the_goal">I. The Goal</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let us first take a step back and consider <em>exactly</em> what we mean by rooting.
Forget flashing custom ROMs, enabling WiFi tethering or installing
Superuser.apk; fundamentally, rooting is about obtaining root access to the
underlying Linux system beneath Android and thus gaining absolute control over
the software that is running on the device. Things that require root access on a
typical Linux system&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;mounting and unmounting file systems, starting your
favorite SSH or HTTP or DHCP or DNS or proxy servers, killing system processes,
chroot-ing, etc.,&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;require root access on Android as well. Being able to run
arbitrary commands as the root user allows you to do absolutely <em>anything</em> on a
Linux / Android system, and this is real goal of rooting.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Stock OEM Android builds typically do not allow users to execute arbitrary code
as root. This essentially means that you as a user are granted only limited
control over your own device; you can make your device do task <em>X</em> only if the
manufacturer explicitly decided to allow it and shipped a program to do it.  You
will not be able to use third-party apps to accomplish a task that your
manufacturer does not wish you to do. WiFi tethering is a good example of this.
Cell phone carriers obviously do not want you to tether your phone without
paying them additional charges. Therefore, many phones come pre-packaged with
their own proprietary WiFi tethering apps that demand extraneous fees. But
without root access, you will not be able to install a free alternative like
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/"> Wireless Tether For Root
Users</a>. Why this is accepted practice in the industry is a mystery to me.  The
only difference between cell phones, tablets and computers is their form factor;
but while a PC vendor would fail spectacularly if they tried to prevent users
from running arbitrary programs on their machines, cell phone vendors are
clearly not judged along the same lines. But such arguments would belong to
another article.</p></div>

<h3 id="_ii_the_enemy_protection_mechanisms_on_a_stock_oem_android_rom">II. The Enemy: Protection Mechanisms On A Stock OEM Android ROM</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_1_bootloader_and_recovery">1. Bootloader and Recovery</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The bootloader, the first piece of code executed when your device is powered on,
is responsible for loading the Android OS and the recovery system and flashing a
new ROM. People refer to some bootloaders as "unlocked" if a user can flash and
boot arbitrary ROMs without hacking; unfortunately, many Android devices have
locked bootloaders that you would have to hack around in order to make them do
anything other than boot the stock ROM. A Samsung smartphone I had used some
months ago had an unlocked bootloader; I could press a certain combination of
hardware keys on the phone, connect it to my computer, and flash any custom ROM
onto it using Samsung&#8217;s utilities without having to circumvent any protection
mechanisms. The same is not true for my Motorola Droid 2 Global; the bootloader,
as far as I know, cannot be hacked. The Eee Pad Slider, on the other hand, is an
interesting beast; as with other nVidia Tegra 2 based devices, its bootloader is
controllable through the <code>nvflash</code> utility, but only if you know the <em>secure
boot key</em> (SBK) of the device.  (The SBK is a private AES key used to encrypt
the commands sent to the bootloader; the bootloader will only accept the command
if it has been encrypted by the particular key of the device.) Currently, as the
SBK of the Eee Pad Slider is not publicly known, the bootloader remains
inaccessible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>System recovery is the second piece of low-level code on board any Android
device. It is separate from the Android userland and is typically located on its
own partition; it is usually booted by the bootloader when you press a certain
combination of hardware keys. It is important to understand that it is a totally
independent program; Linux and the Android userland is not loaded when you boot
into recovery, and any high-level concept such as root does not exist here. It
is simple program that really is a very primitive OS, and it has absolute
control over the system and will do anything you want as long as the code to do
it is built in. Stock recovery varies with the manufacturer, but often includes
functionalities like reformatting the <code>/data</code> partition (factory reset) and
flashing an update ROM (<code>update.zip</code>, located at the root of the external
microSD card) signed by the manufacturer.  Note I said <em>signed by the
manufacturer</em>; typically it is not possible to flash custom update files unless
you obtain the private key of the manufacturer and sign your custom update with
it, which is both impossible for most and illegal under certain jurisdictions.
However, since recovery is stored in a partition just like <code>/system</code>, <code>/data</code>
and <code>/cache</code> (more about that later), you can replace it with a custom recovery
if you have root access in Linux / Android.  Most people do just that upon
rooting their device; <a href="http://www.clockworkmod.com/">ClockworkMod Recovery</a>
is a popular third-party recovery image, and allows you to flash arbitrary ROMs,
backup and restore partitions, and lots of other magic.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2_adb">2. ADB</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>ADB (see
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/adb.html">the official documentation for ADB</a>)
allows a PC or a Mac to connect to an Android device and perform certain
operations. One such operation is to launch a simple shell on the device, using
the command <code>adb shell</code>. The real question is what user do the commands executed
by that shell process run as. It turns out that it depends on the value of an
Android system property, named <code>ro.secure</code>. (You can view the value of this
property by typing <code>getprop ro.secure</code> either through an ADB shell or on a
terminal emulator on the device.) If <code>ro.secure=0</code>, an ADB shell will run
commands as the root user on the device. But if <code>ro.secure=1</code>, an ADB shell will
run commands as an unprivileged user on the device. Guess what <code>ro.secure</code> is
set to on almost every stock OEM Android build. But can we change the value of
<code>ro.secure</code> on a system? The answer is no, as implied by the <code>ro</code> in the name of
the property. The value of this property is set at boot time from the
<code>default.prop</code> file in the root directory. The contents of the root directory
are essentially <em>copied</em> from a partition in the internal storage on boot, but
you cannot write to the partition if you are not already root. In other words,
this property denies root access via ADB, and the only way you could change it
is by gaining root access in the first place. Thus, it is secure.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_3_android_ui">3. Android UI</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On an Android system, all Android applications that you can see or interact with
directly are running as _un_privileged users in sandboxes. Logically, a program
running as an unprivileged user cannot start another program that is run as the
privileged user; otherwise any program can simply start another copy of itself
in privileged mode and gain privileged access to everything. On the other hand,
a program running as root can start another program as root or as an
unprivileged user. On Linux, privilege escalation is usually accomplished via
the <code>su</code> and <code>sudo</code> programs; they are often the only programs in the system
that are able to execute the system call <code>setuid(0)</code> that changes the current
program from running as an unprivileged user to running as root.  Apps that
label themselves as requiring root are in reality just executing other programs
(often just native binaries packaged with the app) through <code>su</code>. Unsurprisingly,
stock OEM ROMs never come with these <code>su</code>. You cannot just download it or copy
it over either; it needs to have its SUID bit set, which indicates to the system
that the programs this allowed to escalate its runtime privileges to root. But
of course, if you are not root, you cannot set the SUID bit on a program. To
summarize, what this means is that any program that you can interact with on
Android (and hence running in unprivileged mode) is unable to either 1) gain
privileged access and execute in privileged mode, or 2) start another program
that executes in privileged mode.  If this holds, the Android system by itself
is pretty much immune to privilege escalation attempts. We will see the loophole
exploited by on-device rooting applications in the next section.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_iii_fighting_the_system">III. Fighting the System</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So how the hell do you root an Android? Well, from the security mechanisms
described above, we can figure out how to attack each component in turn.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your device happens to have an unlocked bootloader, you&#8217;re pretty much done.
An example is the Samsung phone that I had had. Since the bootloader allowed the
flashing of arbitrary ROMs, somebody essentially pulled the stock ROM from the
phone (using <code>dd</code>), added <code>su</code>, and repackaged it into a modified ROM. All I as
a user needed to do was to power off the phone, press a certain combination of
hardware keys to start the phone in flashing mode, and use Samsung&#8217;s utilities
to flash the modified ROM onto the phone.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Believe it or not, certain manufacturers don&#8217;t actually set <code>ro.secure</code> to 1. If
that is the case, rooting is even easier; just plug the phone into your computer
and run ADB, and you now have a shell that can execute any program as root. You
can then mount <code>/system</code> as read-write, install <code>su</code> and all your dreams have
come true.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But many other Android devices have locked bootloaders and <code>ro.secure</code> set. As
explained above, they should not be root-able because you can only interact with
unprivileged programs on the system and they cannot help you execute any
privileged code. So what&#8217;s the solution?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We know that a number of important programs, including low-level system
services, must run as root even on Android in order to access hardware
resources. Typing <code>ps</code> on an Android shell (either via ADB or a terminal
emulator on the device) will give you an idea. These programs are started by the
<code>init</code> process, the first process started by the kernel (I often feel that the
kernel and the <code>init</code> process are kind of analogous to Adam and Eve&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the
kernel spawns <code>init</code> in a particular fashion, and <code>init</code> then goes on and spawns
all other processes) which has to run as root because it needs to start other
privileged system processes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now here&#8217;s the key insight: if you can hack / trick one of these system
processes running in privileged mode to execute your arbitrary code, you have
just gained privileged access to the system. This how all one-click-root methods
work, including z4root, gingerbreak, and so on. If you are truly curious, I
highly recommend
<a href="http://jon.oberheide.org/files/bsides11-dontrootrobots.pdf">this excellent
presentation on the various exploits used by current rooting tools</a>, but the
details are not as relevant here as the simple idea behind them. That idea is
that there are vulnerabilities in the system processes running as root in the
background that, if exploited, will allow us to execute arbitrary code as root.
Well, that "arbitrary code" is most certainly a piece of code that mounts
<code>/system</code> in read-write mode and installs a copy of <code>su</code> permanently on the
system, so that from then on we don&#8217;t need to jump through the hoops to run the
programs we really wanted to run in the first place.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since Android is open source as is Linux, what people have done is to scrutinize
and reason about the source code of the various system services until they find
a security hole they can leverage. This becomes increasingly hard as Google and
the maintainers of the various pieces of code fix those particular
vulnerabilities when they are discovered and published, which means that the
exploits will eventually become obsolete with newer devices. But the good news
is that manufacturers are not stupid enough to push OTA updates to fix a
vulnerability just to prevent rooting as it is very expensive for them; in
addition, devices in the market are always lagging behind the newest software
releases. Thus, it takes quite some time before these rooting tools are rendered
useless by new patches, and by then hopefully other exploits would have been
discovered.</p></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody" class="entry-content">
    <div class="paragraph"><p>I recently acquired an <a href="http://www.asus.com/Eee/Eee_Pad/Eee_Pad_Slider_SL101">Eee Pad Slider</a>, a truly groundbreaking Android tablet running Honeycomb 3.2. Its unique sliding keyboard allows it to transcend the conventional definition of tablets as content consumption devices while preserving to perfection the intimacy of touch interface interaction. To be honest, however, up until last week I had always seen tablets as these flashy toys whose only purpose in life was to satisfy the vanity of a few mindless and unfortunately privileged gadget fanboys. But I fell in love with the Eee Pad Slider at first sight. This was a device that perfectly bridged that gap between my laptop and my smartphone; this was a device that was as immediately accessible, friendly, and visually appealing as my smartphone for casual use, but as pragmatic and dependable as my Thinkpad T400 when I need to get down and serious and reply to that one email or fix that one bug in my code. It&#8217;s simply the most versatile mobile device between a phone and a full blown PC.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before I am dismissed as a crazed and dangerous fanatic, however, I should admit that I fully understand the fact that the Slider is not the best tablet for everyone. The Slider is probably twice as thick as the iPad or the Samsung Galaxy Tab and about the same price as either one of the two. Its keys are much less comfortable than those on your typical ultraportable laptop. It is also brown, a color I would not place very high on my list of good colors for electronic devices. It is probably not the best consumer lifestyle gadget you can find on the market, nor the most suitable for mobile office computing. But it is a very innovative and intelligent cross of the two worlds, and that happened to be exactly that one device I could not find in the hugely diverse and volatile market of mobile devices of today.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Back, then, to the real deal. I am a computer geek and I cannot live very well without SSH. On Android the SSH client that I (and it looks like everyone else) have been using is ConnectBot. So among the first apps I installed on my brand new Eee Pad Slider was ConnectBot; <em>finally</em> I thought, there was a mobile keyboard that had real control, shift, and alt keys that I could use. I was very surprised, therefore, when I realized that none of them worked. Given that the Slider has only been released for a month, forum threads and other helpful resources are nonexistent. I dug up <a href="http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/wiki/KeyboardShortcuts"> the discussion on this document</a> and found <a href="https://github.com/lorantkurthy/connectbot">Lorant Kurthy&#8217;s fork of ConnectBot on GitHub</a> that fixed the same issues for the Eee Pad Transformer. I cloned his repository and, with a one-line change in the source code, enabled his fix for the Slider as well. So there we go - here is <a href="/assets/files/ConnectBot-release.apk">my version of ConnectBot with fixes for the Eee Pad Transformer and Eee Pad Slider hardware keyboards</a>. As far as I can tell it works fine; in fact, I am typing this post on the Eee Pad Slider using Vim in an SSH session to my laptop via my version of ConnectBot. All the credit goes to Lorant Kurthy though.</p></div>
